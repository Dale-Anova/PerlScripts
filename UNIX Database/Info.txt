This perl script implements a primitive expert system, by accepting rules and queries from STDIN and printing the results to STDOUT.
Currently, the script is configured to create/read from a database file named "memory.db".

Rules:
'Key' is a(n) 'Value'.

Queries:
    [Type-A]: What is 'Key'?
    [Type-B]: Who is a(n) 'Value'?
